# Data-Science-with-python
This Repository can be used as handbook for getting familiar with Data Science with python.

This repository will be helpful to those who have a good understanding of python programming language. If you dont have any prior knowledge about python concepts then don't worry, you can learn it very easily....Just go to the link (), learn the concepts and then come back :)

This covers the basic python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and other libraries that will be used for performing analysis, plotting and playing with data.

This also contains the execution of some of the functionalities of each and every library. I hope the comments provided will help you to get an idea of what each line of code performs.

Note:   The executions were performed in Python IDLE 3.7 (You can download it from here ()) and they
        are just copied and pasted from the shell.

If you are facing any problems during the learning process then do mail me on shaikhasad710@gmail.com

Happy Learning !
